# Preface — Introduction

**Summary:** What we're building and why it matters.

## Introduction

This series is about building intelligence from the ground up.

In 2017, a team at Google published a paper called "Attention Is All You Need." The transformer was born. And it changed everything.

A transformer is a type of neural network that processes sequences of data like text, pixels, or sound waves using attention. If that sounds abstract, that's OK. We'll fix that.

> We're going to build a character-level language model from scratch, trained on Star Trek: Deep Space Nine scripts, that can generate new scenes. And by the end, you'll understand how transformers work.

We'll start with the fundamentals.

## Objectives
- Set expectations for the project and outcomes.
- Outline the end-to-end LLM we will build.

## Notes
_TBD as the chapter is written._

## Checkpoint
- Suggested tag: `chapter-01-intro`.
